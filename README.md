## Glossary 

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Database</strong></dt>
  <dd>An organized collection of structured data stored and accessed electronically.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Table</strong></dt>
  <dd>A collection of related data organized in rows and columns. Also known as a relation in relational databases.</dd>
    
  <dt><strong>Data Type</strong></dt>
  <dd>The classification of data that determines what values can be stored. Common types include INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE, and BOOLEAN.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Attribute</strong></dt>
  <dd>A characteristic or property of an entity, represented as a column in a database table. For example, in a customer table, attributes might include name, email, and phone number.</dd>
  
  <dt><strong>Column</strong></dt>
  <dd>The vertical component of a database table that holds specific pieces of data about each record. Each column has a defined data type.</dd>
  
  <dt><strong>Record/Row</strong></dt>
  <dd>A horizontal component of a table that contains a complete set of information about an entity.</dd>  

  <dt><strong>Relationship</strong></dt>
  <dd>The logical connection between tables that shows how data in different tables is related. For example, how customer orders connect to customer information.</dd>  

  <dt><strong>Instance</strong></dt>
  <dd>A running version of a database that users can connect to and interact with. One database schema can have multiple instances.</dd>  

  <dt><strong>Instance</strong></dt>
  <dd>A running version of a database that users can connect to and interact with. One database schema can have multiple instances.</dd>  
  
  <dt><strong>Backup</strong></dt>
  <dd>A copy of database data stored separately from the primary database, used for recovery in case of data loss or system failure.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Constraint</strong></dt>
  <dd>Rules applied to data in tables to maintain data integrity. Common constraints include PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, and NOT NULL.</dd>
  
  <dt><strong>Foreign Key</strong></dt>
  <dd>A column or combination of columns that creates a link between data in two tables, maintaining referential integrity.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Primary Key</strong></dt>
  <dd>A column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table.</dd>  
  
  <dt><strong>Index</strong></dt>
  <dd>A data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on database tables.</dd>
  
  <dt><strong>Join</strong></dt>
  <dd>An operation that combines rows from two or more tables based on related columns between them.</dd>
  
  <dt><strong>Normalization</strong></dt>
  <dd>The process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity, typically through the application of normal forms.</dd>
  
  <dt><strong>Query</strong></dt>
  <dd>A request for data or information from a database, typically written in SQL.</dd> 

  <dt><strong>Schema</strong></dt>
  <dd>The logical structure that represents the design of a database, including tables, relationships, constraints, and other elements.</dd> 
  
  <dt><strong>Transaction</strong></dt>
  <dd>A sequence of database operations that is treated as a single unit of work, following ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).</dd> 

  <dt><strong>View</strong></dt>
  <dd>A virtual table based on the result set of a stored SQL query. Views can simplify complex queries and provide an additional security layer.</dd> 

  <dt><strong>DBMS - Data base management service.</strong></dt>
  <dd>This is a software system designed to manage, store, retrieve, and update data in databases. It serves as an interface between the database and its users or applications.</dd>
  
  <dt><strong>SGDB - ServiÃ§o de Gerenciamento de Banco de Dados.</strong></dt>
  <dd>The Portuguese equivalent of DBMS. Note that it's "SGBD" rather than "SGDB" - the letters represent "Sistema de Gerenciamento de Banco de Dados."</dd>
  
  <dt><strong>RDBMS - Relation data base management service.</strong></dt>
  <dd>A specific type of DBMS that manages relational databases, where data is stored in tables with relationships between them. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.</dd>
  
  <dt><strong>SQL - Structured Query Language</strong></dt>
  <dd>The standard language used to communicate with and manipulate relational databases. SQL enables tasks like querying data, updating records, and managing database structures.</dd>
